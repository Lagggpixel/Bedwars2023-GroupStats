> #### If you want to use the API make sure to load your plugin after BedWars1058-GroupStats .

1. Add it as softdepend in plugin.yml: softdepend: ``[BedWars1058-GroupStats]``
2. Check if BedWars1058-GroupStats is on the server:

```java
@Override
public void onEnable() {
    //Disable if pl not found
    if (Bukkit.getPluginManager().getPlugin("BedWars1058-GroupStats") == null) {
            getLogger().severe("BedWars1058-GroupStats was not found. Disabling...");
            Bukkit.getPluginManager().disablePlugin(this);
            return;
    }
}
```
> #### Initializing the API:
```java
GroupStatsAPI groupStatsAPI = Bukkit.getServicesManager().getRegistration(GroupStatsAPI.class).getProvider();
```
> #### Fetching player statistics: (example of fetching winstreak)
```java
// uuid perameter is the uuid of the player
// cache perameter is a boolean, if true, the stats would be fetched from the cache (realtime). If false, the stats would be fetched from the database.
// group perameter specifics which group data is demanded.
GroupStatsAPI.getPlayerStatisticsMap(uuid, cache).get(group).getWinstreak(); // retuns winstreak of specified group
```
